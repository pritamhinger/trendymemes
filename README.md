This repository contain an iOS app written in Swift. 
This is part of my Nanodegree Assignment. 
The app is as per the specification given at :
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bt-SoB1GgqLebcT2mtE6hglkByzlxrobR5eHFMGPcTg/pub

Further this app allows to change the position of the text to be placed within the image. 
Also user can select one of the several available fonts in system.
The app also stores the memes created within the app and show them in 
Collection View (the memes images are stored in an array as off now. Can be stored to permanent storage).
